# Hierarchical / Multilevel / Mixed Effects Models

Repo contains foundational materials and examples  implementing a Bayesian and Frequentist Hierarchical models on simulated bounce rate data.

These materials are related to the following Towards Data Science articles:

- **foundations**: [When Mixed Effects (Hierarchical) Models Fail: Pooling and Uncertainty]( https://towardsdatascience.com/when-mixed-effects-hierarchical-models-fail-pooling-and-uncertainty-77e667823ae8)

## Main Content

- **foundations**: Materials covering hierarchical model foundations with toy examples, basic implementation and evaluation of frequentist models and a primer on Bayesian models

- **lmm**: Materials covering Bayesian hierarchical (mixed effects) models in R and Python. Topics cover implementation, diagnostics, and evaluation.

- **data**: contains data sets used throughout all the implementations
